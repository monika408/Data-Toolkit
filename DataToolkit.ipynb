        "1. **What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?**  \n",
        "   - NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and efficient mathematical operations, making it essential for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **How does broadcasting work in NumPy?**  \n",
        "   - Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding their dimensions to match. This improves efficiency and reduces the need for explicit loops.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is a Pandas DataFrame?**  \n",
        "   - A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a table in SQL or Excel, where data is stored in rows and columns. It is widely used for data manipulation and analysis.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.**  \n",
        "   - The `groupby()` method is used to group data based on one or more columns and apply aggregate functions like sum, mean, or count to analyze the grouped data efficiently.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?**  \n",
        "  -  Seaborn is built on Matplotlib and provides high-level, aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations. It simplifies complex plots like heatmaps, violin plots, and pair plots while offering built-in themes and color palettes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?**  \n",
        "   - NumPy arrays provide better performance, use less memory, and support element-wise operations, unlike Python lists. They are also optimized for numerical computations and allow efficient broadcasting.  \n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?**  \n",
        "  -  A heatmap is a graphical representation of data using color gradients. It is useful for visualizing correlations, frequency distributions, and matrix-like data structures.  \n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy?**  \n",
        "  -  A vectorized operation means performing element-wise computations on entire arrays without explicit loops, leading to faster execution and better performance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "9. **How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?**  \n",
        "  -  Matplotlib is a static visualization library, whereas Plotly supports interactive and web-based visualizations with zooming, hovering, and dynamic updates.  \n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What is the significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?**  \n",
        "  -  Hierarchical indexing allows multiple levels of indexing in a Pandas DataFrame, enabling multi-dimensional data representation in a single table for better organization and analysis.  \n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is the role of Seaborn’s pairplot() function?**  \n",
        "  -  The `pairplot()` function generates pairwise scatter plots for all numerical columns in a dataset, helping to visualize relationships and correlations between variables.  \n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What is the purpose of the describe() function in Pandas?**  \n",
        "  -  The `describe()` function provides summary statistics of numerical columns, including mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles.  \n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?**  \n",
        "  -  Missing data can affect analysis accuracy. Pandas provides methods like `dropna()`, `fillna()`, and interpolation to handle missing values effectively.  \n",
        "\n",
        "14. **What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?**  \n",
        "  -  Plotly provides interactive, web-based visualizations with features like tooltips, zooming, and real-time updates, making it ideal for dynamic and exploratory data analysis.  \n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?**  \n",
        "  -  NumPy represents multidimensional arrays using the `ndarray` object, which supports efficient slicing, reshaping, and broadcasting for operations across multiple dimensions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is the role of Bokeh in data visualization?**  \n",
        "  -  Bokeh is a Python library for interactive and web-based visualizations. It supports real-time streaming and dashboard creation, making it useful for web applications.  \n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Explain the difference between apply() and map() in Pandas.**  \n",
        "  -  The `apply()` method applies a function to each row or column, while `map()` applies a function element-wise to a single Pandas Series.  \n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What are some advanced features of NumPy?**  \n",
        "  -  NumPy supports advanced features like broadcasting, vectorized operations, linear algebra functions, random number generation, and Fourier transforms.  \n",
        "\n",
        "19. **How does Pandas simplify time series analysis?**  \n",
        "  -  Pandas provides built-in functions for handling datetime objects, resampling, shifting, and rolling window operations, making time series analysis easier.  \n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What is the role of a pivot table in Pandas?**  \n",
        "  -  A pivot table summarizes data by grouping and aggregating values based on multiple columns, making it useful for summarizing large datasets.  \n",
        "\n",
        "21. **Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python’s list slicing?**  \n",
        "  -  NumPy arrays use contiguous memory storage and optimized C-based operations, making slicing faster than Python lists, which store elements as separate objects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What are some common use cases for Seaborn?**  \n",
        "  -  Seaborn is used for statistical data visualization, including correlation analysis (heatmaps), distribution analysis (histograms, violin plots), and relationship analysis (scatter plots, pair plots).  \n",
